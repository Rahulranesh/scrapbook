# LinkedIn Post — Memora App

---

📔 I built an app that takes you back to the 80s and 90s.

Not because it looks retro. Because it *feels* like the real thing.

I just shipped **Memora** — a vintage-themed digital scrapbook app built entirely in Flutter. No subscription. No cloud required. Just you, your photos, and a virtual cork board.

*Memora. Memories, always.*

Here's what it does:
🗂️ Create multiple scrapbook boards — Cork, Felt, or Photo Album style
📸 Add Polaroid-style photos with tape corners and multi-layer shadows
🗒️ Write sticky notes in a handwritten font with a color picker
⭐ Drop vintage stickers (stars, hearts, smileys — full 80s/90s set)
🔄 Drag, resize, rotate everything freely on the canvas
📤 Export your board as an image or PDF and share it instantly
📅 Browse a chronological Timeline of all your memories
📊 See Statistics on your scrapbooking habits
🎨 Switch app themes — the whole design system re-skins dynamically

The design was just as important as the features.

I used **Special Elite** (typewriter font) for headings and **Caveat** (handwriting font) for notes. Every shadow is warm-tinted, not cold grey. A paper texture overlay runs across every screen at low opacity. Every animation — the film reel loader, the Polaroid slide, the page turn transition — exists to deepen the nostalgic feeling, not just to look cool.

**Tech stack:**
→ Flutter + Dart (single codebase, iOS & Android)
→ Provider for state management
→ SharedPreferences for local persistence
→ screenshot + share_plus + image_gallery_saver for export
→ google_fonts for the vintage typography
→ pdf + printing for PDF export

What's also worth mentioning — this entire app was developed at a very rapid pace with the help of AI. From idea to a fully working product, AI accelerated every step of the process. It didn't replace the thinking — it amplified it.

The hardest part wasn't the code. It was resisting the urge to modernize the design. Dark mode and glassmorphism are fine — but there's something different about an app that looks like it was printed on aged paper.

If you're thinking about your next side project: reach into the past. Nostalgia is a powerful design tool. And don't be shy about letting AI help you ship faster.

The app is called **Memora** — a word I coined from *memory* + the Latin *-ora* (aura of time). Simple, unique, and impossible to forget.

Happy to share the repo or talk through any of the architectural decisions. Drop a comment or DM me. 👇
